# Release Agent — WordPress Block Plugins & Themes

This agent automates the complete release lifecycle for WordPress block plugins and themes, managing versioning, changelog enforcement, git tagging, and WordPress.org directory preparation.

## Agent Role & Responsibilities

The release agent acts as the authoritative release coordinator:

1. **Pre-Release Analysis**
   - Scans repository health (tests, lint, documentation)
   - Validates version alignment across all project files
   - Audits changelog completeness and format
   - Confirms WordPress compliance (plugin/theme headers, readme.txt structure)
   - Produces pre-release checklist and risk assessment

2. **Version Management**
   - Determines next version using SemVer
   - Updates VERSION file, plugin headers, theme metadata, readme.txt
   - Ensures consistency across all version sources
   - Handles pre-release versions (beta, RC) if applicable

3. **Changelog Orchestration**
   - Validates Keep a Changelog format
   - Moves Unreleased entries to dated version section
   - Creates fresh Unreleased section for next cycle
   - Generates release notes with highlights and contributor list

4. **Git & GitHub Integration**
   - Creates release/vX.Y.Z branch
   - Commits version and changelog changes
   - Creates annotated git tag: vX.Y.Z
   - Pushes branch and tag to GitHub
   - Opens PR from release branch to main
   - After merge: publishes GitHub Release with assets

5. **WordPress.org Preparation**
   - Validates plugin/theme headers against wordpress.org guidelines
   - Prepares SVN-ready package structure (trunk, tags/X.Y.Z)
   - Generates wordpress.org-compatible readme.txt
   - Creates release bundle for manual SVN sync

6. **Post-Release Coordination**
   - Verifies branch sync (main/develop)
   - Creates backport PRs for hotfixes
   - Logs release in audit trail
   - Generates handoff documentation for next cycle

## Agent Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the release agent, ensure:

```bash
# 1. Working tree is clean
git status  # should show "nothing to commit"

# 2. VERSION file exists and is valid SemVer
cat VERSION

# 3. CHANGELOG.md has Unreleased entries
grep -A 5 "## \[Unreleased\]" CHANGELOG.md

# 4. Plugin header (plugins) or style.css header (themes) is present
# For plugins:
grep "^Plugin Name:" *.php

# For themes:
grep "^Theme Name:" style.css

# 5. Tests and lint pass
npm test && npm run lint

# 6. Git history is clean (no merge conflicts)
git log --oneline -5
```

### Release Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Pre-Release Readiness

```bash
/release --dry-run
```

The agent will:
- Check repository health (tests, lint, docs)
- Validate version alignment
- Audit changelog format and entries
- Confirm WordPress compliance
- Output a pre-release report and checklist

**Expected output:**
- ✅ Pre-release checklist (all items green or yellow)
- ⚠️ Warnings (missing docs, outdated links)
- 🚫 Blockers (failing tests, incomplete changelog)
- Recommended scope (patch/minor/major)

#### Step 2: Confirm Release Scope

If dry-run passes, the agent asks for release scope:

```
Which release scope?
[ ] patch (bug fixes, docs)
[ ] minor (backward-compatible features)
[ ] major (breaking changes)
```

The agent suggests a scope based on commit analysis. You can override if needed.

#### Step 3: Execute Release (with Confirmation)

```bash
/release --scope=patch
```

The agent will:
1. Create `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from develop
2. Update VERSION, plugin/theme headers, readme.txt
3. Move Unreleased entries in CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit: "release: vX.Y.Z"
5. Create annotated tag: vX.Y.Z
6. Push branch and tag to GitHub
7. Open PR from release/vX.Y.Z to main

**Important:** The agent pauses before each major step and asks for confirmation.

#### Step 4: Review & Merge Release PR

GitHub CI gates run on the release PR:
- Tests pass
- Lint passes
- Changelog validation passes
- Version files are aligned

Once gates pass and you review the changes:

```bash
# Approve and merge the PR
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge
```

The agent will then:
1. Verify PR was merged
2. Publish GitHub Release with changelog excerpt and contributor list
3. Confirm tag is published
4. Generate WordPress.org sync file

#### Step 5: WordPress.org Submission (Manual or Automated)

For plugins:
```bash
svn co https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/YOUR_PLUGIN/trunk .
# Copy files from generated release bundle
svn add new-files
svn ci -m "Version X.Y.Z"
```

For themes, submit through wordpress.org theme directory or use SVN sync.

#### Step 6: Post-Release Handoff

The agent generates:
- Release audit log (timestamp, version, contributor credits)
- Handoff notes for next maintainer
- Suggestion for next-cycle starting point
- Issues for follow-up work (docs, backports)

### Scope Rules

**Patch release:** bug fixes, documentation, security patches, minor refactoring
- Bumps: 1.2.3 → 1.2.4
- Safe to auto-approve if quality gates pass
- Can be released immediately

**Minor release:** backward-compatible features, enhancements, deprecations
- Bumps: 1.2.3 → 1.3.0
- Requires manual review of features
- Changelog must list Added and Changed sections
- Should include testing of new features

**Major release:** breaking changes, significant refactoring, major milestones
- Bumps: 1.2.3 → 2.0.0
- Requires detailed changelog with BREAKING CHANGE callout
- Needs migration guide if applicable
- Should include transition period for deprecated features
- Post-release communication essential

### Dry-Run & Rollback

Always start with `--dry-run`:

```bash
/release --scope=patch --dry-run
```

This produces:
- Pre-release checklist (read-only)
- Proposed version bump (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
- Draft changelog section
- Draft release notes
- Proposed git commands (not executed)

If you need to rollback a published release:

```bash
# 1. Delete the tag locally and remotely
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z

# 2. Delete GitHub Release via web UI or:
gh release delete vX.Y.Z

# 3. Revert the release commit on main
git revert <COMMIT_SHA>
git push origin main

# 4. Issue a new patch release when ready
/release --scope=patch
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

If the release process fails:

### Failure: Tests don't pass

```
❌ npm test failed with exit code 1

Pre-release gates:
  ✅ Repository has clean working tree
  ✅ VERSION file is valid SemVer
  ✅ CHANGELOG.md is properly formatted
  ❌ npm test failed
  ⏭️  Skipped: lint checks, changelog validation (blocked by test failure)

Recommendations:
  1. Fix failing tests: npm test -- --watch
  2. Commit fixes: git add -A && git commit -m "fix: failing tests"
  3. Retry release: /release --dry-run
```

### Failure: Version mismatch

```
❌ Version mismatch detected

  VERSION file:           1.2.3
  Plugin header:          1.2.2  ❌
  readme.txt Stable tag:  1.2.3  ✅
  style.css (if theme):   1.2.3  ✅

Fix:
  1. Update plugin header: edit *.php, set Version: 1.2.3
  2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "chore: sync versions"
  3. Retry: /release --dry-run
```

### Failure: Changelog format invalid

```
❌ CHANGELOG.md validation failed

Issues:
  - Line 3: Expected "## [Unreleased]" but found "## [UNRELEASED]" (case-sensitive)
  - Line 8: Unknown section "[Enhancement]" (allowed: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)

Fix:
  1. Edit CHANGELOG.md
  2. Change line 3: ## [Unreleased] (exact case)
  3. Rename section on line 8: ### Added
  4. Retry: /release --dry-run
```

## Advanced Usage

### Force a specific version (override SemVer)

```bash
/release --version=2.1.0
```

This skips version calculation and uses the provided version directly. Useful if you're jumping versions or aligning with external scheduling.

### WordPress.org only (skip GitHub)

```bash
/release --org-only
```

Creates WordPress.org-ready package without GitHub tag/release. Useful for syncing existing versions to wordpress.org or republishing.

### Verify a previous release

```bash
/release --verify --version=1.2.3
```

Audits a past release: checks tag exists, release notes are complete, WordPress.org package is ready, audit trail is logged.

### Generate handoff for next maintainer

```bash
/release --handoff
```

Creates a comprehensive handoff document:
- Release history (last 5 releases)
- Audit trail of recent changes
- Next recommended actions
- Common troubleshooting
- Maintainer contact info

## Logging & Audit Trail
