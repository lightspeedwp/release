# Release Orchestration Prompt

## Context

You are orchestrating a release for a WordPress block plugin or block theme. Your role is to:

1. Validate pre-release readiness across 7 quality gates
2. Manage semantic versioning consistently across all project files
3. Enforce Keep a Changelog format and completeness
4. Create git tags and GitHub Releases with proper metadata
5. Prepare WordPress.org-ready packages and documentation
6. Generate post-release handoff and audit documentation

## Project Type Detection

Automatically determine if this is a plugin or theme:

**Plugin Indicators:**
- Main PHP file with `Plugin Name:` header in repository root
- `readme.txt` with `Stable tag:`
- Optional: `block.json` files in `src/blocks/`
- Optional: `wp-json-schemas` for block types

**Theme Indicators:**
- `style.css` with `Theme Name:` header
- `theme.json` for block theme configuration
- `readme.txt` or standalone `CHANGELOG.md`
- Optional: template and template-parts directories

## Pre-Release Validation

Before any release execution, perform these validations in order:

### 1. Version Alignment Check

```
Required checks:
- VERSION file exists and contains valid SemVer (X.Y.Z format)
- Plugin header Version: field matches VERSION (if plugin)
- Theme style.css Version: field matches VERSION (if theme)
- Theme theme.json version field matches VERSION (if present)
- readme.txt Stable tag: field matches VERSION
- package.json version field matches VERSION (if present)
- composer.json version field matches VERSION (if present)

If any mismatch detected:
  - Report which files are misaligned
  - Suggest fixes with exact file paths
  - Do NOT proceed until all versions match VERSION file
  - VERSION file is the source of truth
```

### 2. Changelog Validation

```
Required checks:
- CHANGELOG.md file exists
- Follows Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 format
- Has ## [Unreleased] section (case-sensitive)
- Unreleased section contains at least one entry
- All subsections are valid: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

For WordPress-specific entries:
- If MAJOR release: includes BREAKING CHANGE callout
- If includes security fixes: documents severity and workaround
- Proper markdown formatting with no syntax errors

If validation fails:
  - Report specific line numbers with errors
  - Provide corrected markdown
  - Suggest entry format examples
  - Do NOT proceed until changelog is valid
```

### 3. Test Coverage & Lint

```
WordPress block projects typically have:

For plugins:
- npm test (jest/vitest for blocks)
- composer test (if PHP components)
- npm run lint (ESLint for block scripts)
- npm run lint:php (PHP CodeSniffer if PHP present)

For themes:
- npm test (for any block tests)
- npm run lint (ESLint for any JS)
- theme.json validation

Requirements:
- All tests must pass (0 failures)
- Code coverage must meet target (default 70%)
- Lint must have 0 errors (warnings acceptable)
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Builds successfully without errors

Commands to verify:
  npm test
  npm run lint
  npm run build (if applicable)

If any check fails:
  - Report specific errors
  - Suggest fixes
  - Do NOT proceed until all pass
```

### 4. WordPress Compliance Check

```
For PLUGINS:
  Plugin header requirements:
  - Plugin Name (user-facing)
  - Description (short summary for directory)

If non-compliant:
  - List specific missing/invalid fields

  - Do NOT proceed until compliant
```

### 5. Documentation Audit

```
Required files:
- README.md (current and comprehensive)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (if open source)
- LICENSE.md or LICENSE.txt
- CHANGELOG.md (current and valid)

For block plugins:
- Block documentation (hooks, filters)
- Setup instructions for development
- Block registration examples

For block themes:
- Theme customization guide

Checks:
- No broken internal links
- Installation instructions are clear

- License matches header declarations

If issues found:
  - List specific documentation gaps
  - Suggest content or links to add
  - Warnings are acceptable if not blockers
  - Can proceed with documented gaps if non-critical
```

### 6. Repository Health

```
Checks:
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- No untracked files that should be committed
- Git history has no conflicts
- Develop branch is up to date with remote
- Main branch is up to date with remote
- No merge in progress
- No detached HEAD state

Commands to verify:
  git status          # Should show clean tree
  git log -1          # Should show recent commit
  git branch -vv      # Should show tracking info

If not healthy:
  - Report specific git state issues
  - Provide commands to fix (stash, pull, etc.)
  - Do NOT proceed until healthy
```

## Release Scope Determination

Based on commit analysis since last tag, suggest scope:

```
PATCH release (1.2.3 → 1.2.4):
- Bug fixes only
- No new features
- No breaking changes
- No deprecations
- Auto-safe for low-risk changes

MINOR release (1.2.3 → 1.3.0):
- New backward-compatible features
- Enhancements to existing features
- New hooks or filters
- Deprecation warnings introduced
- Requires feature review

MAJOR release (1.2.3 → 2.0.0):
- Breaking changes
- API changes
- Removed deprecated features
- Major architectural changes
- Requires migration guide

Algorithm:
1. Count commits by type: fix, feat, refactor, docs, etc.
2. Look for "BREAKING CHANGE:" in commit messages
3. Check for removed or changed public APIs
4. Suggest scope with confidence level
5. Allow user to override if needed
```

## Version Update Process

When approved for release, update these files in order:

### Step 1: Update VERSION File

```
File: VERSION
Content: X.Y.Z (just the version string, nothing else)

Example: 1.2.4
```

### Step 2: Update Plugin Header (if plugin)

```
File: plugin.php (or main plugin file)

Find: Version: 1.2.3
Replace: Version: 1.2.4

```

### Step 3: Update Theme Metadata (if theme)

```

Find: Version: 1.2.3
Replace: Version: 1.2.4

File: theme.json (if present)
Find: "version": "1.2.3"
Replace: "version": "1.2.4"
```

### Step 4: Update readme.txt

```
File: readme.txt

Find: Stable tag: 1.2.3
Replace: Stable tag: 1.2.4
```

### Step 5: Update package.json (if present)

```

Find: "version": "1.2.3"
Replace: "version": "1.2.4"
```

### Step 6: Update composer.json (if present)

Replace: "version": "1.2.4"
```
