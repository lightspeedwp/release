# WordPress.org Sync Skill

Prepares WordPress block plugins and themes for publication on WordPress.org directory and manages SVN repository synchronization for ongoing releases.

## Purpose

This sub-skill streamlines WordPress.org publishing by:

- **Validating** plugin/theme compliance with wordpress.org requirements
- **Preparing** SVN repository structure and assets
- **Automating** readme.txt formatting for plugin/theme directory listing
- **Managing** asset uploads (screenshots, banner, icon)
- **Syncing** releases to WordPress.org SVN
- **Verifying** successful publication on wordpress.org

## WordPress.org Directory Structure

### Plugin SVN Repository

WordPress.org plugins use this SVN structure:

```
my-plugin/
├── trunk/
│   ├── my-plugin.php
│   ├── readme.txt
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── icon-128x128.jpg
│   │   ├── icon-256x256.jpg
│   │   ├── screenshot-1.png
│   │   ├── screenshot-2.png
│   │   └── banner-772x250.jpg
│   ├── includes/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── blocks/
│       └── ...
├── tags/
│   ├── 1.0.0/
│   │   ├── my-plugin.php
│   │   ├── readme.txt
│   │   ├── includes/
│   │   └── blocks/
│   │
│   └── 1.1.0/
│       └── ...
└── branches/
    └── (optional: development branches)
```

### Theme SVN Repository

WordPress.org themes use similar structure:

```
my-theme/
├── trunk/
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── theme.json
│   ├── readme.txt
│   ├── screenshot.png
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── template-parts/
│   ├── patterns/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── screenshot.png (1200x900px)
│   │   └── banner-772x250.jpg
│   └── ...
├── tags/
│   ├── 1.0.0/
│   │   └── (full theme copy)
│   └── 1.1.0/
│       └── ...
└── branches/
    └── (optional)
```

## SVN Repository Setup

### First-Time Plugin Setup

```bash
# 1. Get SVN repository URL from WordPress.org
# After plugin approval: https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/my-plugin/

# 2. Create local SVN working copy
svn checkout https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/my-plugin/ my-plugin-svn
cd my-plugin-svn

# 3. Verify structure exists
ls -la
# Should show: trunk/ tags/ branches/

# 4. Copy plugin files to trunk/
cp -r ../my-plugin-github/* trunk/

# 5. Add wordpress.org assets to assets/
mkdir -p trunk/assets
cp ../artwork/icon-128x128.png trunk/assets/
cp ../artwork/banner-772x250.png trunk/assets/
cp ../artwork/screenshot-*.png trunk/assets/
```

### First-Time Theme Setup

```bash
# 1. Get SVN repository URL
# After theme approval: https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/my-theme/

# 2. Create local SVN working copy
svn checkout https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/my-theme/ my-theme-svn
cd my-theme-svn

# 3. Copy theme files to trunk/
cp -r ../my-theme-github/* trunk/

# 4. Copy screenshot
cp ../artwork/screenshot.png trunk/
```

## Release: Tag Creation in SVN

### Creating a Version Tag

When releasing version 1.2.4:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to SVN working copy
cd my-plugin-svn

# 2. Copy trunk/ to tags/X.Y.Z/
svn cp trunk/ tags/1.2.4/

# 3. Verify copy
svn status
# Should show A (added) for tags/1.2.4/

# 4. Commit to WordPress.org
svn commit -m "Tagging 1.2.4 release"
# (WordPress.org verifies version in headers matches tag name)
```

### Updating Stable Tag

Update readme.txt to mark stable version:

```
Stable tag: 1.2.4
```

Then commit:

```bash
svn add trunk/readme.txt
svn commit -m "Update stable tag to 1.2.4"
```

## Complete Release Sync Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare SVN Working Copy

```bash
# 1. Ensure SVN copy is up to date
cd my-plugin-svn
svn update

# 2. Check status (should be clean)
svn status
```

### Step 2: Sync trunk/ with Latest Release

```bash
# 1. Clear current trunk/
rm -rf trunk/*

# 2. Copy latest plugin files
cp -r ../my-plugin-github/* trunk/

# 3. Check what changed
svn status trunk/

# 4. Add/delete files as needed
svn add trunk/path/to/new/file
svn delete trunk/path/to/old/file

# 5. Review changes
svn diff trunk/ | head -100
```

### Step 3: Update readme.txt

Ensure readme.txt in trunk/:
- Has correct "Stable tag: X.Y.Z"
- Has up-to-date changelog
- Has correct plugin/theme headers

```bash
# Verify readme.txt was updated
cat trunk/readme.txt | grep "Stable tag"
# Should show: Stable tag: 1.2.4
```

### Step 4: Verify Assets

For plugins, verify assets/:

```bash
# Check assets present
ls trunk/assets/
# Should include:
# - icon-128x128.png (or .jpg)
# - icon-256x256.png (or .jpg)
# - banner-772x250.png (or .jpg)
# - screenshot-1.png, screenshot-2.png, etc.
```

### Step 5: Create Version Tag

```bash
# Copy trunk to tags/1.2.4
svn cp trunk/ tags/1.2.4/

# Verify
svn status
# A tags/1.2.4/
```

### Step 6: Commit All Changes

```bash
# Commit trunk updates
svn commit -m "Release 1.2.4: Add hero block and performance improvements"

# Commit tag creation (if needed separately)
svn commit -m "Tagging 1.2.4"
```

### Step 7: Verify on wordpress.org

```bash
# 1. Visit plugin/theme page
https://wordpress.org/plugins/my-block-plugin/

# 2. Check version is correct
# Should show: Version 1.2.4

# 3. Check changelog
# Should show recent entries from readme.txt

# 4. Check assets appear
# Icon, banner, and screenshots should be visible
```

## Troubleshooting SVN Issues

### SVN Authentication Failed

```bash
# 1. Verify WordPress.org account
# Plugin/theme must be approved and you must have commit access

# 2. Generate SVN credentials
# Visit: https://wordpress.org/support/article/svn-and-git-clients/

# 3. Re-authenticate
svn cleanup
svn update
# Will prompt for username/password
```

### Version Mismatch Error

```bash
❌ Error: Version in header (1.2.3) doesn't match tag (1.2.4)

# Fix:
# 1. Update plugin/theme header to match tag
# 2. Update VERSION file
# 3. Commit to SVN
```

### Asset Upload Failed

```bash
❌ Banner not showing on wordpress.org

# 1. Verify file path: assets/banner-772x250.jpg
# 2. Verify dimensions: 772×250 pixels
# 3. Verify file format: .jpg, .jpeg, or .png
# 4. Re-add to SVN:
svn add trunk/assets/banner-772x250.jpg
svn commit -m "Add plugin banner"

# 5. WordPress.org regenerates after ~1 hour
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep SVN Separate** — Maintain separate SVN working copy, don't mix with git repo
2. **Test Before Sync** — Verify wordpress.org compliance before each release
3. **Tag Carefully** — Ensure version matches exactly (1.2.4, not 1.2.4.0)
4. **Asset Dimensions** — Follow wordpress.org asset size requirements exactly
5. **Document Changes** — Keep readme.txt changelog up to date
6. **Verify Publish** — Always check wordpress.org after sync to confirm success
