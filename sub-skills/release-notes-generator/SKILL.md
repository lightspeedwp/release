# Release Notes Auto-Generator Skill

Automatically generates professional, multi-format release notes from CHANGELOG.md entries and git commit history, with contributor attribution, issue linking, and WordPress-specific patterns for block plugins and themes.

## Purpose

This sub-skill accelerates release communication by:

- **Extracting** changelog entries and commit history since last release
- **Parsing** conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Aggregating** issues closed by the release
- **Attributing** contributors and providing credit
- **Generating** multiple output formats (GitHub Release, email, Slack, blog)
- **Formatting** with contextual emojis, version links, and contributor mentions
- **Customizing** tone and detail level (brief, detailed, technical)

This saves significant time on release communication while ensuring consistency and professionalism across channels.

## When to Use

### Optimal Timing

- **After** release is tagged (git tag applied)
- **Before** GitHub Release is announced
- **Before** WordPress.org sync begins
- **For** every release cycle (major, minor, patch)

### Common Scenarios

- Publishing release notes to GitHub Release page
- Drafting email newsletter announcement
- Creating Slack channel announcement
- Writing blog post about release
- Generating release email for subscribers
- Creating WordPress.org readme changelog section

## What It Does

### 1. Changelog Parsing

The skill reads `CHANGELOG.md` and extracts:

- Version number and release date
- All entries from the [Unreleased] section (or specified version)
- Organized by section: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- WordPress-specific patterns (new blocks, themes, patterns)
- Cross-references to blocks, hooks, and features

**Example input (CHANGELOG.md):**
```markdown
## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- New Image Gallery block with lightbox support
- New gallery layout: Masonry Grid
- New `my_plugin_gallery_lightbox_enabled` filter
- New theme option for gallery gutter spacing

### Changed
- Updated Image Gallery block to use modern block API (v3)
- Improved gallery image loading performance by 40%
- Enhanced gallery inspector with live preview

### Fixed
- Fixed gallery layout breaking on mobile devices
- Resolved lightbox overlay z-index issues
- Fixed image alt-text not syncing to block attributes

### Security
- Added nonce verification to gallery AJAX endpoints
```

### 2. Commit Message Parsing

Extracts and categorizes commits using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

**Supported Types:**
- `feat:` — New features (maps to "Added")
- `fix:` — Bug fixes (maps to "Fixed")
- `perf:` — Performance improvements (maps to "Changed")
- `docs:` — Documentation updates
- `refactor:` — Code refactoring (maps to "Changed")
- `style:` — Code style changes
- `test:` — Test additions/updates
- `chore:` — Build, CI, dependency updates
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` — Maps to major version change

**Scope Recognition:**
- `feat(hero-block):` — Identifies block name
- `fix(theme-colors):` — Identifies theme feature
- `perf(editor):` — Identifies component
- Converts to readable format in release notes

**Example:**
```
feat(gallery-block): add lightbox support for image gallery
fix(gallery): resolve z-index conflict in lightbox overlay
perf(gallery-block): optimize image rendering performance
```

### 3. Issue Linking & Attribution

Automatically extracts and links:

- **Issue references:** Detects `#123` in commit messages
- **PR references:** Recognizes PR numbers from merge commits
- **GitHub URLs:** Converts issue IDs to full GitHub links
- **Closing keywords:** Recognizes "Closes #123", "Fixes #456"
- **Contributor mentions:** Extracts author from commit metadata

**Example commits:**
```
fix: resolve gallery lightbox on mobile (fixes #456)
feat: add image gallery block (#123)
perf: optimize block rendering (#456, #789)
```

### 4. Contributor Attribution

Identifies all contributors to the release:

- **Commit authors** — From git commit history
- **PR reviewers** — From GitHub API (when available)
- **Mentioned contributors** — From issue comments
- **Format options:**
  - Simple: "Thanks to @alice, @bob, and @charlie"
  - Detailed: "Thanks to contributors: @alice (3 commits), @bob (2 commits)"
  - With roles: "Built by Alice (Dev), Reviewed by Bob (QA)"

#### A. GitHub Release Format

**Features:**
- Structured markdown with emoji indicators
- Issue link references with #IDs
