# Release QA Skill

Performs comprehensive pre-release quality assurance and validation for WordPress block plugins and themes.

## Purpose

This sub-skill coordinates seven quality gates before release publication:

1. **Test Coverage** — All unit and integration tests pass
2. **Code Quality** — Lint, formatting, and static analysis pass
3. **Version Alignment** — All version sources match
4. **Changelog Validation** — Keep a Changelog format and completeness
5. **WordPress Compliance** — Plugin/theme headers and wordpress.org guidelines
6. **Documentation Audit** — README, contributing guides, inline comments
7. **Repository Health** — Git state, branch protection, CI status

## Pre-Release Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Test Coverage

**What it checks:**
- All unit tests pass: `npm test` or `composer test`
- Integration tests pass (if present)
- No test files are skipped
- Code coverage meets minimum threshold (default: 70% for new code)
- E2E tests pass (if present)

**For WordPress projects:**
- Block registration tests pass
- Taxonomy and CPT tests pass
- Hook/filter callback tests pass
- Database migration tests pass (if applicable)

**Command to validate:**

```bash
npm test
# or
composer test
# or
npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration
```

**Output:**
```
✅ All tests passed (42 tests, 2.3s)
✅ Code coverage: 82% (target: 70%)
✅ No skipped tests
✅ Integration tests passed (8 tests)
```

### Gate 2: Code Quality & Lint

**What it checks:**
- No ESLint errors or critical warnings
- No PHP CodeSniffer violations (WordPress standards)
- No unused variables or imports
- Code formatting matches project standards
- Security linting passes (no known vulnerabilities)

**For WordPress projects:**
- WordPress coding standards (PHPCS)
- Block.json validation
- theme.json validation (for block themes)
- Proper escaping and sanitization
- No deprecated WordPress functions

**Command to validate:**

```bash
npm run lint
# or
npm run lint:js && npm run lint:php && npm run lint:css
# or
composer run phpcs
```

**Output:**
```
✅ ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
✅ PHP CodeSniffer: 0 violations
✅ CSS Lint: 0 errors
✅ Unused imports check: OK
✅ Security audit: No vulnerabilities
```

### Gate 3: Version Alignment

**What it checks:**
- `VERSION` file exists and contains valid SemVer
- Plugin header `Version:` matches VERSION file
- Theme `style.css` `Version:` matches VERSION file
- Theme `theme.json` version matches (if present)
- `readme.txt` `Stable tag:` matches VERSION file
- `package.json` version matches VERSION file (if present)
- `composer.json` version matches VERSION file (if present)

**Command to validate:**

```bash
npm run check:versions
# or manually:
grep -i "Version:" plugin.php
grep "^Version:" style.css
grep "\"version\":" theme.json
grep "Stable tag:" readme.txt
```

**Output:**
```
✅ VERSION file: 1.2.4
✅ plugin.php Version: 1.2.4 ✅
✅ style.css Version: 1.2.4 ✅
✅ theme.json version: 1.2.4 ✅
✅ readme.txt Stable tag: 1.2.4 ✅

- Unreleased section is not empty
- Subsections are valid (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security, Documentation, Performance)
- Changelog structure is consistent
- All subsections have entries
- Links to version comparisons are valid

**For WordPress releases:**
- If MAJOR: includes BREAKING CHANGE callout
- If SECURITY: includes security fix details
- Minimum viability: at least one entry in Unreleased

**Command to validate:**

```bash
npm run check:changelog
# or manually:
grep -A 20 "## \[Unreleased\]" CHANGELOG.md
```

**Output:**
```

```
Release Risk Assessment for v1.2.4

Risk Score: 0.15 (LOW RISK - Safe to release)

Breakdown:
- Test coverage: 0.0 (all tests pass)
- Code quality: 0.05 (minor lint warnings)
- Version alignment: 0.0 (perfect alignment)
- Changelog completeness: 0.0 (fully documented)
- WordPress compliance: 0.0 (fully compliant)
- Documentation: 0.1 (minor doc gaps)
- Repository health: 0.0 (excellent health)

Recommendation: APPROVE FOR RELEASE ✅

No blockers detected. Safe to proceed with release.
```

## Automated Approval Rules

Based on risk score:

| Scope | Risk Score | Auto-Approve? |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Patch | ≤ 0.3 | ✅ Yes |
| Patch | > 0.3 | ❌ Manual review required |
| Minor | ≤ 0.2 | ✅ Yes |
| Minor | > 0.2 | ❌ Manual review required |
| Major | Any | ❌ Always manual |

## Integration

This skill is called by the main `release` skill during the validation phase:

```bash
/release --dry-run  # Runs all QA gates
```

It can also be called independently:

```bash
/release-qa --project-type=plugin --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests failing but were passing yesterday

```
❌ npm test failed

Investigation steps:
  1. Check for dependency updates: npm list --depth=0
  2. Clear cache: npm cache clean --force
  3. Reinstall: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
  4. Run tests again: npm test
```

### Version mismatch detected

```
❌ Version mismatch

Fix:
  1. Identify the source: VERSION file is the source of truth
  2. Update all others to match: plugin.php, style.css, readme.txt
  3. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "chore: sync versions to 1.2.4"
  4. Retry: /release-qa
```
