# Changelog Management Skill

Manages changelog entries, validates format compliance, and coordinates automatic versioning for WordPress block plugins and themes using the Keep a Changelog standard.

## Purpose

This sub-skill helps teams maintain clear release documentation by:

- **Creating** properly formatted changelog entries
- **Validating** Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 format compliance
- **Organizing** entries into standardized sections
- **Automating** version numbering and dating
- **Coordinating** changelog with version files
- **Preventing** incomplete or malformed entries

## Keep a Changelog Format

The CHANGELOG.md follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) standard, which provides:

- **Clarity** — Users immediately see what's changed
- **Structure** — Consistent organization across versions
- **Searchability** — Clear sections and version history
- **Automation** — Machine-readable format for tooling

### Standard Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Validation Rules

### CHANGELOG.md Must Have:

1. **Main Heading**
   ```
   # Changelog
   ```

2. **Description**
   ```
   All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
   ```

3. **[Unreleased] Section**
   ```
   ## [Unreleased]

   (At least one entry)
   ```

4. **Valid Subsections**
   - Only use: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   - Case-sensitive: `### Added` (not `### added` or `### ADDED`)
   - Can be empty except at least one must have content

5. **Version Format**
   - Follows Semantic Versioning: `X.Y.Z`
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Example: `## [1.2.4] - 2026-10-30`

6. **Comparison Links** (optional but recommended)
   ```
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/org/repo/compare/v1.2.4...HEAD
   [1.2.4]: https://github.com/org/repo/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4
   ```

## Common Changelog Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Missing [Unreleased] Section

**Error:**
```
❌ CHANGELOG validation failed

## [1.2.4] - 2026-10-30

...
```

### Issue: Invalid Section Name

**Error:**
```
❌ CHANGELOG validation failed
   Invalid subsection: "Features" (use "Added" instead)
   Invalid subsection: "Bug Fixes" (use "Fixed" instead)
```

**Fix:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added              # Was "Features"

### Fixed             # Was "Bug Fixes"
- Fixed rendering issue

(Remove custom sections like "Features", "Improvements", etc.)
```

### Issue: Empty Unreleased Section

```

```

❌ ## [1.2.4] - Oct 30, 2026
✅ ## [1.2.4] - 2026-10-30
```

## Release Integration

### Before Release

```bash
# 1. Validate changelog
npm run check:changelog

# 2. Review entries
cat CHANGELOG.md | head -30

# 3. Verify version matches
grep "Stable tag:" readme.txt
head -1 VERSION
```

### During Release

The [[release]] skill:

1. Determines version type (patch/minor/major)
2. Moves [Unreleased] entries to version section
3. Dates the new section with today's date
4. Creates fresh [Unreleased] section
5. Adds comparison links
6. Commits and tags

### Post-Release

```bash
# Verify changelog was updated
git show HEAD:CHANGELOG.md | head -50

# Verify git tag was created
git tag | grep "v1.3.0"

# Verify version files updated
grep "Version:" plugin.php
```

## Changelog in Release Notes

The [[release]] skill uses CHANGELOG.md to generate GitHub Release notes:

```markdown
## What's Changed

### Added
- New card block component
- New hero block positioning filter

### Changed
- Improved block editor performance

### Fixed
- Fixed card block shadow rendering

## Best Practices

1. **Update as You Go** — Add changelog entries when PRs merge, not at release time
2. **User-Focused** — Write for end users, not developers
3. **One Entry Per Item** — Don't combine multiple fixes/features
4. **Be Specific** — Describe impact, not just technical change
5. **Link to Issues** — Reference issue numbers when relevant
6. **Keep It Short** — One line per entry is usually enough

## Changelog Workflow

```
Development
  ↓
PR merged with [Unreleased] entry added
  ↓
Multiple PRs merged, entries accumulate
  ↓
Ready to release
  ↓
Run: /release --dry-run
  ↓
Changelog validated and dated automatically
  ↓
Release published with notes from changelog
```

## Integration with Release Skill

This skill is called by [[release]] during version management:

```bash
/release --dry-run  # Includes changelog validation
/release --scope=minor  # Updates changelog automatically
```

## Integration with Hook Configuration

Pre-commit hooks can validate changelog:

```yaml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    validate-changelog:
      glob: "CHANGELOG.md"
      run: npm run validate:changelog
```
